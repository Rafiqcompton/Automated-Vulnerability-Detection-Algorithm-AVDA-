This function loads a pre-trained machine learning model and uses it to predict whether a given code snippet contains a vulnerability. 
The model would need to be trained on a large dataset of code snippets and their corresponding vulnerability labels.



def AVDA(code_snippet):
    trained_model = load_model('vulnerability_model')
    prediction = trained_model.predict(code_snippet)
    return prediction
