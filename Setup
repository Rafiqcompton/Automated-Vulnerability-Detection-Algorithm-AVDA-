Collect a large dataset of code snippets and their corresponding vulnerability labels.
Preprocess the data to a suitable format for a machine learning model.
Train a machine learning model on this data. This could be a deep learning model using libraries like TensorFlow or a simpler model using scikit-learn.
Save the trained model to a file
